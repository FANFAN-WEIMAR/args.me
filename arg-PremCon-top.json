The father was DEAD from a knife wound. Not much anyone could have done to help. Besides, what makes you think the kid cared about his father? You said yourself that his father beaten and abused him, for at least 13 years. Even if he didn't kill the father that doesn't mean he cared about him. \"The fact is that if the boy didn't kill his father someone else did. The father is dead with a knife in his father's chest that is much like the one the kid had and admitted to having. There are so many coincidences here.

It is explicitly stated that two witnesses, one of whom did NOT see the crime being committed, were the entire case for the prosecution. Of the 11 other men in the room when this is said, at least 2 of whom are obsessed with proving the boy's guilt almost to the point of insanity, noone objects to this.

He may have remembered them but been too nervous to speak. Even if he didn't remember the title or stars, there's never any indication that he didn't remember the plot. \"The child was arguing with his father and then yelled I'm going to kill you.\" According to shaky witness testimony. \"Plus the man down the hall saw the kid leaving the crime scene.\" Again, according to shaky witness testimony. \"The actual murder used the same weapon that the kid had.\" Yes, but the weapon was not unique and didn't have any fingerprints on it. I'd also like to point out one more detail, which is the nature of the wound. The murderer had stabbed the father at a downward angle, which would require an overhand stab, but switchblade knives are designed to be used underhanded. The boy was by all accounts very handy with a switch knife and must certainly have known this. It's unlikely that he would have made the kind of wound that the murderer did. In conclusion, I have shown that the witness testimony is shaky at best, and the physical evidence does not prove that he was even there when the murder occurred, let alone that he committed it.

The murderer had stabbed the father at a downward angle, which would require an overhand stab, but switchblade knives are designed to be used underhanded.
